/* Leaf space — pixel/README.md, Step 2.
 *
 * Step 3 blends four cells per output pixel. That is only meaningful if the
 * same (u,v) picks the same anatomical point out of every cell, and the raw
 * files do not give you that for free: they arrive at two different
 * resolutions (583x555 and ~1024x970) with silhouettes that agree closely but
 * not exactly. This module defines the common space and the operations that
 * put a cell into it.
 *
 *   leaf space = the cell's alpha bounding box, resampled to LEAF_PX square.
 *
 * Three consequences worth stating, because each is a decision:
 *
 * 1. The bounding box, not the image frame. The frame is incidental — it is
 *    whatever the generator emitted. The alpha bbox is the leaf.
 *
 * 2. Squashed to a square, not letterboxed. Cell aspect ratios span
 *    1.046-1.075; normalising them away is what makes (u,v) line up. The true
 *    proportion is not lost, it moves into ASPECT, and Step 4 restores it in
 *    the destination rectangle it is already computing.
 *
 * 3. One alpha for the whole grid, not one per cell. Every cell is meant to be
 *    the same leaf, so per-cell silhouette differences are generator noise. If
 *    they are blended, the disagreement band at the lobe tips composites
 *    opaque against transparent and leaves a grey fringe. Sharing a single
 *    consensus alpha removes the artefact by construction, and means Step 3
 *    blends three channels instead of four. Colour must then be defined
 *    slightly outside each cell's own mask — see fillOutward.
 *
 * Node:    var LS = require('./leafspace.js');
 * Browser: <script src="leafspace.js"></script>   // then window.LeafSpace

   * is. This asks "is this pixel's RGB the leaf's actual colour?", and on a
   * partly transparent pixel it is not: these cells carry a pale fringe in
   * their antialiased edge (measured mean brightness 152 against 127 in the
   * blade), and canvas hands back unpremultiplied values there, which
   * amplifies whatever error is present as alpha falls.
   *
   * That colour is harmless while it is drawn at the alpha it came with. It
   * stops being harmless the moment the grid shares one silhouette, because
   * the shared alpha can call a pixel opaque that this cell had half-covered
   * — and then the fringe is composited at full strength. It reads as a pale
